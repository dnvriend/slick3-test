If this time is exceeded without a connection becoming available, a SQLException will be thrown. 1000ms is the minimum value. Default: 300 (30 seconds)
  
  validationTimeout = 5000 // This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection will be tested for aliveness. This value must be less than the connectionTimeout. The lowest accepted validation timeout is 1000ms (1 second). Default: 5000
  
  idleTimeout = 600000 // 10 minutes: This property controls the maximum amount of time that a connection is allowed to sit idle in the pool. Whether a connection is retired as idle or not is subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds, and average variation of +15 seconds. A connection will never be retired as idle before this timeout. A value of 0 means that idle connections are never removed from the pool. Default: 600000 (10 minutes)
  maxLifetime = 1800000 // 30 minutes: This property controls the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. When a connection reaches this timeout it will be retired from the pool, subject to a maximum variation of +30 seconds. An in-use connection will never be retired, only when it is closed will it then be removed. We strongly recommend setting this value, and it should be at least 30 seconds less than any database-level connection timeout. A value of 0 indicates no maximum lifetime (infinite lifetime), subject of course to the idleTimeout setting. Default: 1800000 (30 minutes)
  leakDetectionThreshold = 0 // This property controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged indicating a possible connection leak. A value of 0 means leak detection is disabled. Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection is 2000 (2 secs). Default: 0

  initializationFailFast = true // This property controls whether the pool will "fail fast" if the pool cannot be seeded with initial connections successfully. If you want your application to start even when the database is down/unavailable, set this property to false. Default: true
